        <p class="text"> My name's Julius Palttala, and I'm a Finnish Software Developer student at Tredu.
        I like to listen to music, play videogames and take landscape pictures.
        I'm an open-minded person and I'll always try to keep the mood of the group as high as possible. 
        "No matter how dark it is outside, I'll always try to cheer everyone up with the brightest (or darkest) joke, that i can come up with"-Me, 5. December, 2023.

    <h1 class="title">What have I done so far?</h1>
    <p class="text" >I've done some school projects including a single page website and random number generating game.
        Now I've been re-designing my father's company's websites as a personal project. 
        I am also planning on starting my very own game project using Unreal Engine.
